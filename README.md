# WordPress Plugin Boilerplate
A standardized, organized, object-oriented foundation for building high-quality WordPress Plugins.  Sourced from Tom McFarlin and Devin Vinson's original.  Modified to suit.

## Contents
The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate includes the following files:

* `.gitignore`. Used to exclude certain files from the repository.
* `CHANGELOG.md`. The list of changes to the core project.
* `README.md`. The file that youâ€™re currently reading.
* A `plugin-name` directory that contains the source code - a fully executable WordPress plugin.

## Features
* The Boilerplate is based on the [Plugin API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API), [Coding Standards](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards), and [Documentation Standards](http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/inline-documentation-standards/php-documentation-standards/).
* All classes, functions, and variables are documented so that you know what you need to be changed.
* The Boilerplate uses a strict file organization scheme that correspond both to the WordPress Plugin Repository structure, and that make it easy to organize the files that compose the plugin.
* The project includes a `.pot` file as a starting point for internationalization.

## Recommended Tools

### i18n Tools
The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate uses a variable to store the text domain used when internationalizing strings throughout the Boilerplate. To take advantage of this method, there are tools that are recommended for providing correct, translatable files:

* [Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/)
* [makepot](http://i18n.svn.wordpress.org/tools/trunk/)
* [i18n](https://github.com/grappler/i18n)

Any of the above tools should provide you with the proper tooling to internationalize the plugin.

## Important Notes

### Includes
Note that if you include your own classes, or third-party libraries, there are three locations in which said files may go:

* `plugin-name/includes` is where functionality shared between the admin area and the public-facing parts of the site reside
* `plugin-name/admin` is for all admin-specific functionality
* `plugin-name/public` is for all public-facing functionality

Note that previous versions of the Boilerplate did not include `Plugin_Name_Loader` but this class is used to register all filters and actions with WordPress.

The example code provided shows how to register your hooks with the Loader class.

# Credits
The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate was started in 2011 by [Tom McFarlin](http://twitter.com/tommcfarlin/) and has since included a number of great contributions. In March of 2015 the project was handed over by Tom to Devin Vinson.

The current version of the Boilerplate was developed in conjunction with [Josh Eaton](https://twitter.com/jjeaton), [Ulrich Pogson](https://twitter.com/grapplerulrich), and [Brad Vincent](https://twitter.com/themergency).

The homepage is based on a design as provided by [HTML5Up](http://html5up.net), the Boilerplate logo was designed by  Rob McCaskill of [BungaWeb](http://bungaweb.com), and the site `favicon` was created by [Mickey Kay](https://twitter.com/McGuive7).
